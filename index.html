            <p>
                First we note that when you identify a thing, it is *one* thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then we add a thing to one thing that we already have
                and have *two* things. So we count things one by one through
                addition of a thing to a group of things (or by adding
                a unique thing to a set of things and taking that set's new
                cardinality). <br>
                You can make an error in counting if you count the same thing
                again: this is called double-counting.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do numbers look? They are only these ten digits
                (numerals) combined. <br>
            </p>
<pre>
{0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}.
</pre>
            <p>
                For example, 31; 27; 143; and 2,147,483,647. <br>
                0 is special and is thanks to the Arabic people.
                As a species, we have always been able to say there are none
                of something, but we didn't invent the numeral 0 for a long 
                time.
            </p>



            <h2>Thirteen distinct counting numbers ("primary colors")</h2>
            <p>
                We have these names that we use for the first ten counting
                numbers: <br>
            </p>
<pre>
{one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten}.
</pre>
            <p>
                Verify that there are ten fingers on your two hands.
                In English there are more than ten distinct numbers: <br>
            </p>
<pre>
{eleven, twelve}.
</pre>
            <p>
                There are twelve distinct numbers. <br>
                In fact, there are thirteen distinct numbers
                if you count zero (0). That is, if you add zero to the set
                of unique counting numbers and take its cardinality. So now
                we have thirteen primary "colors" with which we can "paint"
                the counting numbers, along with a set of modifiers. We only
                use forms of one through ten for writing numbers less than or
                equal to 99, after which we introduce modifiers like hundred,
                thousand, and m&#x2011;illion, which comes with its own modifiers
                like b-, tr-, and quadr-.
            </p>
<pre>
{zero,
 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
 eleven, twelve}
</pre>



            <h2>Seven "-teens"</h2>
            <p>
                Then there are the seven -teens.
            </p>
<pre>
[thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen].
</pre>
            <p>
                These next seven numbers are of the form
            </p>
<pre>
10 + [3..9].
</pre>      
            <p>
                The new forms include "thir" for three, "fif" for five, and
                "teen" for ten.
            </p>



            <h2>Eight sets of ten</h2>
            <p>
                Once we get to [twenty], the counting numbers begin following
                a very predictable pattern: along with twenty, here are the
                next ten numbers after nineteen.
            </p>
<pre>
[twenty twenty-one twenty-two ... twenty-nine].
</pre>
            <p>
                Notice how the twenties are just
            </p>
<pre>
20 + [0..9].
</pre>
            <p>
                Also notice that [twenty] is twen-ty or two tens. <br>
                New forms include "twen" for two and "ty" for ten. <br>
                The next seventy numbers follow the same pattern, with new
                forms including "for" for four, and "eight" combining with "ty", 
                which result in eight sets of ten.
            </p>
<pre>
[thirty  thirty-one  thirty-two  ... thirty-nine].
[forty   forty-one   forty-two   ... forty-nine].
[fifty   fifty-one   fifty-two   ... fifty-nine].
[sixty   sixty-one   sixty-two   ... sixty-nine].
[seventy seventy-one seventy-two ... seventy-nine].
[eighty  eighty-one  eighty-two  ... eighty-nine].
[ninety  ninety-one  ninety-two  ... ninety-nine].
</pre>



            <h2>Hundreds</h2>
            <p>
                Then the nine hundreds appear, with each hundred containing
                a copy of each the thirteen distinct numbers, the seven -teens,
                and the eight sets of ten.
            </p>
<pre>
[one hundred .. one hundred ninety-nine].
.
.
.
[nine hundred .. nine hundred ninety-nine].
</pre>



            <h2>Thousands</h2>
            <p>
                Then thousands (also each called grand, which is a collective
                singular term) each contain nine hundreds. The thousands,
                ten&#x2011;thousands, and hundred&#x2011;thousands are separated
                from the hundreds, tens, and ones by a comma, so 1,000 = one
                thousand and 999,009 = nine hundred and ninetey&#x2011;nine
                thousand and nine.
            </p>
<pre>
[one thousand .. one thousand nine hundred ninety-nine].
[two grand .. two grand nine hundred ninety-nine].
.
.
.
[nine grand .. nine grand nine hundred ninety-nine].
.
.
.
[ten thousand .. ten thousand nine hundred ninety-nine].
.
.
.
[nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand .. 999,999]
</pre>
            <p>
                You can have ten grand, one hundred grand ... 
                nine hundred ninety-nine grand, and for each its
                hundreds, tens and ones.
            </p>



            <h2>-illions</h2>
            <p>
                Then millions, billions, trillions, quadrillions, quintillions,
                sextillions, septillions, octillions, nonillions. <br>
                You can have one million .. nine hundred ninety-nine million,
                and then the billion is one grand *times* more in a
                *multiplicative* sense.
            </p>



            <h1 id="Addition">Addition</h1>
            <p>
                While counting is done by adding one to a number, what if you
                have two groups of digits representing two numbers that you
                arrived at by counting? <br>
                Could you add them?
            </p>

5 - 1 = 4.
