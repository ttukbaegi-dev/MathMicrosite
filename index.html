<!-- A. Zero, One, Counting, and Discovery -->
            <h2>The existence of new things</h2>
            <p>
                First we note that when you identify a new thing, you
                have counted *one* thing. <br>
                Before this thing is counted there are no things, or
                *zero* things.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then we add a thing to the one thing that we already have
                and have *two* things. This is called counting, or counting
                upwards. We count things one by one by putting one thing into
                a group of things which contain a known number of things. <br>
                Note that we can only count into a group of things that
                initially contains zero (0) things. Zero is where counting
                starts, because it is all we know before we see a thing to
                count.<br>
                You can make an error in counting if you count the same thing
                again: this is called double-counting.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do numbers look? They are only these ten numerals 
                combined in "place value" order:

                $$ \text{{0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}} $$
            
                For example, 31; 27; 143; and 2,147,483,647. 0 is special and
                is thanks to the Arabic people, who also gave us the rest of
                these numerals, though these rest of them are a bit less special.
                As a species, we have always been able to say there are none
                of something, but we didn't invent the numeral 0 for a long 
                time.
            </p>
<!-- B. What is place-value notation? -->
            <h2>What is the place-value way to write a number?</h2>
            <p>
                Place-value notation means that each number has: <br>
                1) places, and 2) values at each place. <br>
                So that means that this number:

                $$ 31,415,926,535 = \text{TRUNC}(10,000,000,000 * \pi) $$

                has 11 places, which each weigh ten (10) times more than
                the previous one, starting from the right end.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rightmost (first) place has a weight of one (1). <br>
                The second place value has a weight of ten (10). <br>
                
                (Notice how ten is written. With ten, there is a one (1)
                in the second place value, which we know by definition to be
                ten times heavier. So ten is one (1) ten.) <br>

                The third place value has a weight of one hundred (100). <br>
                The fourth place value has a weight of one thousand (1,000). <br>
                The fifth place value has a weight of ten thousand (10,000).

                $$\begin{aligned}
                         1 &= 1 * 1 \\
                        10 &= 10 * 1 \\
                       100 &= 10 * 10 \\
                     1,000 &= 10 * 100 \\
                    10,000 &= 10 * 1,000
                \end{aligned}$$

                So each place can hold ten things, if we include one through nine
                as well as zero things.
            </p>
<!-- (one) first place (one's place) -->
            <h3>First place value (_ times one) or one's place</h3>
            <p>
                Starting from the
                right end of the number, the first digit has a place *weight*
                of 1. So its place value is just the intrinsic bin value 5.

                $$ 5 $$
            </p>

                (also division as an inverse (opposite) of multiplication.)
            </h3>
            <p>
                To get the place value of the second digit (3), you would first
                need to know how to add more than just individual 1's onto a
                number (count up from a number), but just imagine this: the 3
                *weighs* ten times \((10 * 3)\) heavier than the value in the
                first place (5). So follow the reasoning below:
            </p>
<!-- (a) Grouping (proof of the commutative property of addition) -->
            <h4>
                First phase: Grouping
            </h4>
            <p>
                $$\begin{aligned}
                    30 = 10 * 3 &= (3 + 3) \\
                                &+ (3 + 3) \\
                                &+ (3 + 3) \\
                                &+ (3 + 3) \\
                                &+ (3 + 3)
                \end{aligned}$$

                That is, there are ten groups of 3 in the place value of the second digit,
                which I write as five groups of (3 + 3), or 6. So it is also true that
                
                $$
                    5 * 6 = 30
                $$
                
                Now we split the first group of a pair of 3's (or 6) into ones. We note that with
                addition, there is a property called associativity, which groups and ungroups
                (associates and un-associates) numbers using parentheses: "(" the left paren and
                ")" the right paren. This we use to ungroup the six ones that make up the first
                group of 6, and re-group these "free" ones into two groups of 5 and 1, respectively.
                
                $$\begin{aligned}
                    30 = 5 * 6 &= ((1 + 1 + 1) + (1 + 1 + 1)) \\
                               &+ (3 + 3) \\
                               &+ (3 + 3) \\
                               &+ (3 + 3) \\
                               &+ (3 + 3) \\
                    30 = 5 * 6 &= ((1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + 1) \\
                               &+ (3 + 3) \\
                               &+ (3 + 3) \\
                               &+ (3 + 3) \\
                               &+ (3 + 3)
                \end{aligned}$$

                Let's do the same thing to each of the four remaining groups of 6, thus editing
                all five groups of 6 the same way, which leaves us with 5 * 6 written a different
                way.

                $$\begin{aligned}
                    30 &= ((1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + 1) \\
                       &+ ((1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + 1) \\
                       &+ ((1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + 1) \\
                       &+ ((1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + 1) \\
                       &+ ((1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + 1) \\
                    30 &= 5 * ((1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + 1) \\
                    30 &= 5 * (5 + 1)
                \end{aligned}$$
                
                Take the five stragglers and make them another group of five.

                $$\begin{aligned}
                    30 &= 5 * (5 + 1) \\
                       &= 5 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + 5 * 1 \\
                       &= 5 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \\
                       &= 6 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \\
                       &= 6 * 5
                \end{aligned}$$
                
                That is, five groups of six is the same as six groups of five.
                This is called commutativity, with the first number leaving its
                place and the other number replacing it, and the first number
                then taking the place of the second number.
                Now take each pair of groups of five and put them together.
                There are three pairs of groups of five in 6 groups.
                That is, six groups of five is the same as three groups of ten.

                $$\begin{aligned}
                    30 &= 6 * 5 \\
                       &= (3 * 2) * 5 \\
                       &= 3 * (2 * 5) \\
                       &= 3 * 10
                \end{aligned}$$

                So we now have that 30, our second place value, is equal to:

                $$
                    30 = 10 * 3 = 5 * 6 = 6 * 5 = 3 * 10
                $$

                We have regrouped the number into a form which reads out loud
                as "three times ten", or equally "add ten to 0 three times".

                \(\text{[1 2 3 4 5]}\) is the first group, as you would see if you cut

                Now that the groups of 3's have all been broken down and grouped into 
                groups of 10's, we can apply counting on the three groups of ten.
            </p>
            <p>
                Step 1: Expand the tens into ones.

                $$\begin{aligned}
                    30 &= 10 * 3 = 3 * 10 \\
                       &= (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \\

            </p>
            <p>
                Step 2: Prepare to count the first group of 10. Let's do this
                from left to right, starting from zero so that we count ten times
                to reach ten. So we are working in left associative fashion, which
                looks like this.

                $$\begin{aligned}
                    30 &= ((((((((((0 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) \\
                       &+ (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \\

            </p>
            <p>
                Step 3: Fold each \(\text{+ 1}\) into the left, counting up
                the leftmost number each time. We'll do the same thing to the other
                groups of ten by pure repetition, so I will divide the 3 groups of 10
                by 3 to work on the first group of ten alone (\(30 / 3 = 10\)).

                $$\begin{aligned}
                30 / 3 &= (((((((((((0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) \\

                    10 &= (((((((4) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) \\
                    10 &= ((((((5) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) \\
                    10 &= (((((6) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) \\
                    10 &= ((((7) + 1) + 1) + 1) \\

                    10 &= ((9) + 1) \\
                    10 &= (10)
                \end{aligned}$$

                Because we know that 10 * 3 = 3 * 10 = 30, then we have counted up to 30
                by simply counting once to 10 and adding two more groups of 10.

                The total weight is 30. The tens place value is 3, and since we multiply

            <h2>Thirteen distinct counting numbers ("primary colors")</h2>
            <p>
                We have these names that we use for the first ten counting
                numbers:

                $$ \text{\{one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten\}} $$

                Verify that there are ten fingers on your two hands.
                In English there are more than ten distinct numbers: <br>

                $$ \text{\{eleven, twelve\}} $$

                There are twelve distinct numbers. <br>
                In fact, there are thirteen distinct numbers
                if you count zero (0). That is, if you add zero to the set
                of unique counting numbers and take its cardinality. So now
                we have thirteen primary "colors" with which we can "paint"
                the counting numbers, along with a set of modifiers. We use
                only forms of one through ten for writing numbers less than or
                equal to 99, after which we introduce modifiers like hundred,
                thousand, and m&#x2011;illion, the last of which comes with its
                own modifiers like b-, tr-, and quadr-, for two&#x2011;,
                three&#x2011;, or four&#x2011;thousand times more than one

            <h2>Seven "-teens"</h2>
            <p>
                Then there are the seven -teens, which makes 20 numbers total.

                $$\begin{aligned}

                These next seven numbers are of the form

                $$ 10 + [3..9]. $$

                The new forms of the numbers one through ten include
                "thir" for three, "fif" for five, and "teen" for ten.
            </p>

            <h2>Eight groups of ten</h2>
            <p>
                Once we get to [twenty], the counting numbers begin following
                a very predictable pattern: along with twenty, here are the
                next ten numbers after nineteen.

                $$\begin{aligned}
                \text{[twenty twenty-one twenty-two ... twenty-nine].}
                \end{aligned}$$

                Notice how the twenties are just

                $$ 20 + [0..9]. $$

                Also notice that [twenty] is twen-ty or two tens. <br>
                New forms include "twen" for two and "ty" for ten. <br>
                The next seventy numbers follow the same pattern, with new
                forms including "for" for four, and "eight" combining letters
                with "ty", which result in counting eight groups of ten.

                $$\begin{aligned}
                &\text{[thirty  thirty-one  thirty-two  ... thirty-nine].} \\

            <p>
                Then the nine hundreds appear, with each hundred containing
                a copy of each the thirteen distinct numbers, the seven -teens,
                and the eight groups of ten.

            <h2>Nine hundred and ninety nine (more) Thousands</h2>
            <p>
                Then thousands (also each called grand, which is a collective

                and hundred&#x2011;thousand's place are separated from the hundreds,
                tens, and ones by a comma, so \( 1,000 = \text{one thousand} \) and

            <p>
                While counting is done by adding one to a number starting
                from the "seed" of zero, what if you have two numbers that you
                arrived at by counting? <br>
                Could you put them together into one count?
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, take \( 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \). This is just
                counting from the seed 0 to the next number, and so on and so on
                until there is no more counting to be done. That is, in equation
                form:
